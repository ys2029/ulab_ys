    "If you are seeing this notebook, this means that you have successfully updated your clone of my repository. Great work! Since the main focus of this homework is branching/merging I promise I will take it easy on the coding questions. Simply fill out the question below (making sure you are working on your `hw4` branch), upload the changes to GitHub, and then submit a pull request (do not use `git merge`!) to merge your branch to the main code. Feel free to come to office hours (Thursdays 12-2 in the PIL) with any questions/concerns. Happy coding!"

    "## **Problem 1: Finding the Escape Velocity of Solar System Planets**\n",
    "The escape velocity, $v_{\\text{esc}}$ of a planet is given by the equation\n",
    "$$ v_{\\text{esc}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{R}}$$\n",
    "where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ is the mass of the planet, and $R$ is the radius of the planet.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this folder, notice that there is a text file labeled 'planets.csv'. This provides information about all of the planets in our solar system and Pluto. Your task is as follows:\n",
    "1. Read in the csv file using `astropy.table` and identify the `mass` and `diameter` columns.\n",
    "2. Write a function `v_esc` that takes in mass and radius of a planet to calculate the escape velocity.\n",
    "3. Apply your function to all the planets in the table.\n",
    "4. Compare your derived excape velocity values to those in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints:\n",
    "1. The `diameter` column provides values in km,`mass` provides values in kg divided by 1e24, and `escape_velocity` provides values in km/s.\n",
    "2. Keep in mind that you cannot plug in diameter directly to your v_esc function.\n",
    "3. Pull constants from `astropy.constants`\n",
    "4. Check your units to be sure you are getting escape velocity values in km/s (you can use `astropy.units` for this)."
