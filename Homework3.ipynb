The first thing that you should do is create a copy of this notebook and the PREM text file into your personal repository (the one labeled `ulab_yourname`). After that, fill out the practice problem, and then follow the instructions for submission at the bottom of the page. Good luck!"

Your task is to read in the text file using `astropy.table` (code provided) and create a plot of radius from the center of earth (x-axis) versus density of the earth (y-axis). Be sure to add a title, axes labels, and a legend!"
